We need governments and businesses to reach net-zero emissions before 2050. And we need those in power to work together to ensure a sustainable future for all. The clock is ticking. It is time to put words into action and save the world we love.",

They deal with the realities of climate change â€” unending drought in some places, flooding, and rising sea levels in others. They are unable to put food on the table, unable to access basic medicines, education and healthcare, unable to access financing or equity, and therefore unable to offer their children a better future. Many of these people are refugees and internally displaced fleeing conflict areas such as Ukraine, Syria and Venezuela in recent years.",
