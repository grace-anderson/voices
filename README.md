## Description

**Voices** is publishing app built as a single-page MERN application built using React, GraphQL, Node.js and Express.js server, Mongoose ODM and MongoDB. The app provides a safe space for people to become writers by providing tools to write and sharing their stories and creations without the commentary or feedback typical of a social media-style app. 

[Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) was used to kick start app development. [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) was used to create the routing. The app is styled using [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) with the [Emotion styling engine](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction). User authentication is handled using [JWT](https://jwt.io/).

The app is deployed to [Heroku](TODO), with the code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/grace-anderson/voices)
